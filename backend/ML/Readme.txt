We have five models:

1- The main model interacts with the user, asking questions to predict potential diseases based on their answers.
2- The second model utilizes large language models (LLMs) in a chatbot to provide users with guidance on appropriate actions.
3- Our third model focuses on detecting COVID-19 through X-ray analysis, determining if the user is normal or showing signs of COVID.
4- The fourth model predicts the risk of a heart attack and provides users with warnings to increase their awareness and take precautionary measures.
5- Finally, the fifth model is designed to detect diabetes in users.
